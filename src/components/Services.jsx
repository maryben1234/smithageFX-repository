              Synthetic indices are financial instruments that simulate the price movements of various underlying assets, such as stocks, commodities, or currencies. They are created by utilizing complex mathematical models and algorithms to generate synthetic price data. These indices allow traders and investors to speculate on the performance of the underlying market without directly owning the assets. Synthetic indices provide a convenient and accessible way to participate in the financial markets and can be traded on various online platforms.

              Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual form of currency that utilizes cryptography for security and operates on decentralized networks called blockchains. It emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 and has since grown into a diverse ecosystem of thousands of cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrencies enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. They are based on blockchain technology, which ensures transparency, immutability, and decentralized control.
